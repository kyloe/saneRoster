Integration of Fetchroster (ICS Stuff) and saneRoster (Logbook)


Need to 

Add FetchRoster config stuff to the database
	People
	  Their login details assume that the ones in saneROster are current
	  Their format preferences
	  Their source system
	  
	  
	  entity credentials
		username
		password
			  	
	  entity service
		name
		id
		connector (the perl class that connects to this thing
			  	

Rework Fetchroster to use database based preferences rather than the hard coded stuff

Need to move all executables to saneRoster system

	To maintain their own preferences 
	To add 'start numbers' for logbook
	
Develop interface to allow admin to 
	add other source systems
